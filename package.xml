            &lt;p&gt;
                This extension provides a way to let the Discourse forum software (<http://www.discourse.org/>)
                be aware of Contao users. At the moment, this is limited to Single Sign-On of Contao users into
                Discourse, i.e. when logging into Discourse, the user is redirected to a Contao page with the
                module included in this extension and authenticated against the Contao user database, then
                redirected back to the Discourse forum where the login request is validated.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                To get this to work, you need to fill out the SSO settings in the Discourse settings as well as
                the respective fields in the Contao settings! To limit Discourse login privileges, you need to
                limit the visibility/access privileges of the FE module to specific Contao user groups.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                This Version is only for Contao 2.9.x and higher, and may not work in Contao v3. Help with
                porting this extension is greatly appreciated at <https://github.com/fbender/contao-discourse>!
